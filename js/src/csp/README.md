# CSP
This directory contains the front-end components relating to Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSP).

`CSPViewer` handles displaying a CSP that can show the execution of the algorithm, highlighting the corresponding arcs and updating the domains. You can also click on an arc to perform arc consistency on that one arc.

`CSPBuilder` provides a graphical interface to construct CSPs that you can later solve visually with `CSPViewer`.

Check out [`csp.ipynb`](../../../notebooks/csp/csp.ipynb) for a demo.
