# Release Procedure
1. Update `aispace2/_version.py` (generally by incrementing minor) to the next version you plan on releasing. You should also update the version number in `js/package.json` and in `install.html` in `gh-pages` branch for consistency. Make sure the new version is larger than the [currently released version](https://github.com/AISpace2/AISpace2/releases).
2. Make sure you are in the `master` branch (`git checkout master`) and that they are no unpushed changes.
3. Go to our [Releases](https://github.com/AISpace2/AISpace2/releases) page and click **Draft a new release**. Fill in the tag version and release title with the version specified inside `aispace2/_version.py` and list user-facing changes.
4. Download the source code zip file under your new release. The file should be named `AISpace2-X.zip`, where X is the new version number. Unzip it and rename the directory to `AISpace2`, and then zip it again. Put this `AISpace2.zip` into the `assets/` direcroty in `gh-pages` branch to replace the old one. This file will be the one to be downloaded by the users.
