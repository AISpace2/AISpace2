# AISpace2 Website

This is a simple static site for AISpace2. You can check out the currently deployed version [here](https://aispace2.github.io/AISpace2). It contains a product information page, installation instructions, contribute instructions, tutorials and additional information pages.

To run it locally, simply start a HTTP server and navigate to one of the HTML pages. For example, you can run `python -m SimpleHTTPServer` or `python3 -m http.server`.

To update the website, commit and push your changes to the `gh-pages` branch and GitHub will take care of publishing those changes in a few minutes.

We use Google Analytics to collect some user access statistics.
