# AISpace2

## About
AISpace2 is a set of notebooks and an extension for [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org), a web application that combines code, text, and visualizations into a single, rich document. These notebooks teach and demonstrate AI concepts by providing detailed explanations alongside Python code implementations, and the accompanying extension brings these concepts to life by providing interactive visualizations driven directly by the code you see.

AISpace2 is the next version of [AISpace](http://aispace.org), and accompanies the book [_Artifical Intelligence 2E: Foundations of Computational Agents_](http://artint.info) by [David Poole](http://cs.ubc.ca/~poole/) and [Alan Mackworth](http://cs.ubc.ca/~mack/).

We encourage you to check out our [website](https://aispace2.github.io/AISpace2/) for more information, including installation instructions.
