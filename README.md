# AISpace2

## About
This is a work-in-progress Jupyter extension that aims to replace the existing [AISpace](http://aispace.org) Java applets. We want students to be able to interact and play with algorithms, not only visually as with the existing applets, but also by modifying the algorithms' code directly and seeing the results.

## User Installation
See the [website](https://aispace2.github.io/AISpace2/) for the latest installation instructions.

## Contributing
See the wiki for development information.
