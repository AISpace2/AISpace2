        <p>Once you have Jupyter and AISpace2 <a href="install.html">installed</a>, you can download some of the notebooks below to learn and visualize many AI concepts. These notebooks provide a easy way to explore concepts and view available functionality without having to create your own. We recommend you start with these notebooks and customize them as you see fit.</p>
        If this is your first time using Jupyter, we recommend taking a look at the following links to quickly get up to speed:

            <p>If the file doesn't download automatically after clicking the link, and you are redirected to another page instead, you should download these notebooks by right-clicking the link and choosing <strong>Save
                As</strong>. Some web browsers have the tendency to append a <code>.txt</code> file extension to your notebooks when you do this &mdash; if that's the case, youâ€™ll have to rename the file and remove it yourself. You can do this either by using your file browser, or after uploading the notebook to Jupyter in the next step.
            </p>
            <p>Open Jupyter Notebook (by running <code>jupyter notebook</code> in a terminal if you aren't using JupyterHub) and upload the notebook by going to the notebook dashboard, selecting
                <strong>Upload</strong> and choosing the file you just downloaded.

            </p>
            <p>Now, simply open the notebook and run the cells. Congratulations! AISpace2 is now running.</p>
