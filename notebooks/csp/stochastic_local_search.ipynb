    "For large CSPs, systematically searching through the space of assignments of values to variables will prove unviable. This section considers a method intended to work in these very large spaces, __stochastic local search__. Stochastic local search does not systematically search the whole search space but they are designed to find solutions quickly on average. It does not guarantee that a solution will be found even if one exists, and so it is not able to prove that no solution exists. It is often the method of choice for applications where solutions are known to exist or are very likely to exist.\n",
