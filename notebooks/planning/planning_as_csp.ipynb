    "In forward planning, the search is constrained by the initial state and only uses the goal as a stopping criterion and as a source for heuristics. In regression planning, the search is constrained by the goal and only uses the start state as a stopping criterion and as a source for heuristics. By converting the problem to a constraint satisfaction problem (CSP), the initial state can be used to prune what is not reachable and the goal to prune what is not useful. The CSP will be defined for a finite number of steps; the number of steps (also called __horizon__) can be adjusted to find the shortest plan. We can apply any method we learnt before (see [Chapter 4](https://artint.info/2e/html/ArtInt2e.Ch4.html)) in order to solve this CSP and thus find a plan.\n",

Alternatively, you can click the *Play* button in the toolbar, to the left of the stop button.
