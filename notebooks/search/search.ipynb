    "In depth-first search, the frontier acts like a LIFO (last-in, first-out) stack of paths. Using a stack means that the path selected and removed from the frontier at any time is the last path that was added. Depth-first search is appropriate when space is restricted, or when there are many solutions. On the other hand, depth-first search is not appropriate if it is possible to get stuck into infinite paths or if solutions exist at shallow depths."
