This means that the path selected and removed from the frontier at any time is the last path that was added. Depth-first search is appropriate when space is restricted, or when there are many solutions. On the other hand, depth-first search is not appropriate if it is possible to get stuck into infinite paths or if solutions exist at shallow depths."

The explored set is initially empty. When a path $⟨n_0,…,n_k⟩$ is selected , if $n_k$ is already in the explored set, the path can be discarded. Otherwise, $n_k$ is added to the explored set, and the algorithm proceeds as before."
